This is the code for the Tube Chaser web site.

It's written in Django and has been designed to be run on Google App Engine,
but should be fairly easy to port to a standard Django with an SQL database.

It includes the Heat Map code which originally came from the 
http://www.wheredoyougo.net/ FourSquare Heat Map site.
