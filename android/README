This is the source code for the Tube Chaser Android Application.

You can just import the TubeChaser folder as an Android project
into Eclipse with the Android SDK installed.

To generate a package, the secret key is required for it to match
with the Tube Chaser in the Android Market. Also the Google Maps 
API key will need to match for tiles to load.
