app-db-gen
==========
A helper script written in Python for generating the Tube
Chaser initial database. 

It pulls the Tube lines and stations from the TfL web site and generates
an SQLite database in Android format which is then moved into place
once the app is started for the first time.

app-icons
=========
This folder contains the icons for the Android application.

It also contains a gen_icons.sh shell script which generates HDPI, MDPI
and LDPI sized-icons into the application.

It requires Imagemagick for getting image dimensions and Inkscape for
the icon generation from SVG to PNGs.

web-resources
=============
This folder contains image resources for the web site and Android Market.

website-db-gen
==============
This is a helper for generating data for the Tube Chaser App Engine site.

It downloads Line/Station information and outputs it into a JSON format which
is compatible with the Django models found on the web site.

It also includes a list of mobile operators which was pulled from Wikipedia.

This will eventually be used to map from the Mobile Network Code which is
uploaded as part of the 'Send Usage Stats' in Tube Chaser to the actual
mobile provider name for the chart.
