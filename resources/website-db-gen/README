This is a helper for generating data for the Tube Chaser App Engine site.

It downloads Line/Station information and outputs it into a JSON format which
is compatible with the Django models found on the web site.

It also includes a list of mobile operators which was pulled from Wikipedia.

This will eventually be used to map from the Mobile Network Code which is
uploaded as part of the 'Send Usage Stats' in Tube Chaser to the actual
mobile provider name for the chart.
